# hello-world

I am an architect, with an interest in design computation, fabrication, emergence and digital design theory. I have prior experience in architectural practice in London, and for the past few years I have been teaching in the US. I am interested in new design protocols as they emerge from current technologies like development of A.I. and want to get familiar with the processes and opportunities of Machine Learning within a design context.
